This is going to be the start of my twitter-politician project. I want to track the popularity of politicians in the US and in Australia by number of twitter followers at first, and perhaps later some other numbers. I want to store this information and be able to present it graphically over time.

This project will help my skills in:
- data visualization
- web scraping
- task automation
- data handling
